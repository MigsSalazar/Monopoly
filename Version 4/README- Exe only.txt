Welcome to the beta-test version of Mig's Monopoly

To play Monopoly, simply download all files and folders into the same folder
(anywhere is good), and double click the RUN batch file or MyMonopoly executable
just like you would any other computer program.

If the window never shows up or it won't go away, go to task manager and look
for Java(TM) Platform SE binary, select it, and click on "end the task" on the
bottome right.

Hopefully I've made the game play intuitive or you already know how to play
monopoly.

When you've found a bug or if the game crashes, save (if possible) and exit the
game immedietely (DO NOT DO CONTINUE PLAYING!) and record what you did leading
up to the error and what happened in a .txt file. Report it to 
masalzr2@illinois.edu by sending both your .txt file and the most recent log
file generated by the game. To find that, go to the logs folder, and pick the
most recent file. Each log file is saved in the format hh-mm-ss~MM,dd,yy as in
hour-minute-seconds~month,day,year so the bigger the number, the more recently
it was made. Email me the two files with the subject "monopoly bug/crash found"

If you have a feature you'd like to see or have a suggestion to make a current
feature better, please send the suggestion in a .txt file to the same email
with the subject "monopoly feature suggestion"

In the docs folder, you'll find the html java documentation. This can open in
your web browser but if you don't know how to code, I'm not sure how much it can
help you. In the resources folder, you can find the image files used on the board
and the .mnr files storing the default values for new players and properties. Do
NOT change these files! They're template files and should never be changed.
If you wish to access these, they're just renamed .txt files so you can open them
with notepad. You can also find .mns files in the save_name and save_res folders.
These are also just renamed .txt files. If you change these, the game may or may
not be able to read them especially if they're out of format. However, do NOT
change the names of any of these files as it will desyncronize the files.

Hopefully you can enjoy the game! (who ever enjoys playing monopoly?) Thank you
for being my beta-tester!
